    "# Onchain Credit Risk Analysis - Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) What is the problem we are trying to solve? \n",
    "\n",
    "Assess the likelihood that a crypto address will repay borrowed funds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two important factors: ability and willingness.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis attempts to improve understanding around on chain borrower's willingness to repay borrowed funds. Typical reason for repaying borrowed funds in real life revolve around social reputation and a verified individual's ability to access borrowed funds in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) What is considered a bad outcome? \n",
    "\n",
    "Without overcollateralizion, the psudonymous nature of blockchains allows any sybil actor to spin up an address, generate positive activity, access credit, and abscond with the borrowed funds. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the current on chain borrowing paradigm, overcollateralization is required and loan defaults are swiftly resolved through open auctioning of the collateral (i.e., liquidations). \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this analysis, a bad outcome is definded as any lending agreement that results in a liquidation (if liquidation, result = 0, else result = 1). Considered a credit default event. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Can we avoid bad outcomes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Stopping short of full off chain identity verification, is there a way to assess a wallet address's (i.e., borrower's) willingness to repay borrowed funds? \n",
    "\n",
    "__Thesis__\n",
    "\n",
    "The social history of a wallet can tell us how much of the user's true identity is invested in a wallet address. Wallet addresses with greater identity investment are more willing to adhere to loan terms--most importantly in order to preserve the social reputation of the wallet address, as well to preserve the ability to access similar terms in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Thesis Weaknesses__\n",
    "\n",
    "There is not currently a system for penalizing wallets that have defaulted, and thus there is no social or credit profile degradation threat to disincentivize blockchain actors from misbehaving.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Aave v1 lender and borrower data to build a simplified understanding of an address's financial profile. \n",
    "> Assumption: Aave v1 activity portrays the address's complete financial profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the address's social activity data to assess the wallet owner's personal investment into this address's identity. \n",
    "> Assumption: Wallet addresses with greater identity investment are more willing to adhere to loan terms. Importantly, adhering to loan terms means avoiding liquidation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single liquidation is considered a strict loan default event.\n",
    "> Assumption: liquidations are considered a terminal event and strict defualt has occured. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Most recent 250 active address on Aave v1, prior to freezing the protocol in November 2022. \n",
    "\n",
    "For those 250 addresses, the current oustanding loan balance and the most recent 1,000 transactions across the following protocol activities: (1) Deposits, (2) Borrows, (3) Flashloans, (4) Withdrawals, (5) Loan Repayments, (6) Liquidations \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6) Features & Target\n",
    "\n",
    "__Features__:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Total deposits in USD\n",
    " - Total borrowings outstanding in USD\n",
    " - Ratio of total liquidated collateral to total borrowings (USD)\n",
    " - Total flashloans (USD)\n",
    " - Prior repayments made (yes/no)\n",
    " - Prior liquidation event\n",
    " - Address currently resolved to ENS .eth name\n",
    " - Address currently resolved to ENS .eth name with sub domains\n",
    " - Address resolved ENS name age in days\n",
    " - Address currently owns a Lens profile on Polygon\n",
    " - Lens profile name contains 'DAO'\n",
    " - Lens follower count\n",
    " - Lens following count\n",
    " - Lens publication count\n",
    " - Lens collection count\n",
    " - Address is signer on a gnosis safe (polygon only--safe's ethereum subgraph returned indexing errors)\n",
    " - Address holds a bufficorn or $SPORK tokens\n",
    " - Address has donated to gitcoin grants\n",
    " - Address has an ethCC admission ticket \n",
    "\n",
    "__Target__: \n",
    "\n",
    "- result\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7) Analysis & Estimation of Feature Usefulness\n",
    "The social feature set did not provide much signal. Perhaps we need more data. More likely, the industry has yet to systematically describe wallets using on chain social activities, which as previously predicted leave little incentive for wallet addresses to behave. \n",
    "\n",
    "Incomplete picture of user assets and liabilities given the queries do not crawl each user's entire history with aave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems with the below, since liquidations have already occured. Would need future activity to see if past liquidations predict future liquidations.\n",
    " - Ratio of total liquidated collateral to total borrowings (USD)\n",
    "\n",
    "__To Do:__\n",
    "\n",
    "Get data for the following features\n",
    "\n",
    " - Address holds a bufficorn or $SPORK tokens\n",
    " - Address has donated to gitcoin grants\n",
    " - Address has an ethCC admission ticket \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8) Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple decision tree to check accuracy and feature importance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9) Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important feature in my final analysis set was flash loan amount (USD). \n",
    "\n",
    "The feature was negatively correlated with the target variable. Addresses with higher values of flash loans were more likely to have a liquidation event. \n",
    "\n"
